## Description

{This is a simple dice game where two players have the chance to roll the dice to try and achieve a score of 100.

-   When a player rolls a one their turn is over and its time for the next player to play
-   When a player holds its the other players turn to roll and the turns score is added to their score
-   If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
-   when a player scores 100 or more they win }

## Setup/Installation Requirements

-   Internet connection
-   Install atom and git software and a working laptop.

## Known Bugs

{No known bugs at the moment but incase of any please alert me via my email ryanmuuo91@gmail.com }

## Behaviour Driven Development

-   The user rolls the dice where the computer generates a random number
-   When a random number is generated the user rolls again
-   If you roll a one you loose and its the next players turns
-   The first player to score 100 wins!!
